Using XStream to build or parse object from & to XML
= Introduction =

If you ever used Java's XStream http://xstream.codehaus.org/ 
you probably encountered that parsing a XML file with more then a few elements and attributes to those elements may be a hampering task, that comes back to hunt you time & time again.

Why isn't there a simple library that wraps XStream for an even easier configuration ?

Well I guess there are a few out there, but most are too complicated to use and have pretty much specific needs.

I'm wrote a simple one class ! that you just
extends and follow a few simple conventions to use properly :)
